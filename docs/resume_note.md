# Resume Notes

## Status
- Work paused before implementation changes could begin due to token quota exhaustion during previous session.
- Repository instructions remain authoritative; no code modules were modified in this pass.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Re-read `AGENTS.md` at the repository root to ensure compliance with global conventions, especially branding (oc-rsync/oc-rsyncd) and centralized messaging.
2. Audit current binaries and config paths to ensure `oc-` prefixes and `/etc/oc-rsyncd/oc-rsyncd.conf` locations are consistently applied.
3. Verify CI workflow aligns with single Linux test job plus parallel cross-compilation targets as required by the consolidated mission brief.
4. Continue production release readiness tasks: close remaining protocol/feature parity gaps, enforce documentation standards, and reconfirm coverage â‰¥95%.

## Notes
- No tests were executed in this session.
- Pending tasks should reference `docs/production_scope_p1.md` to maintain convergence discipline.
