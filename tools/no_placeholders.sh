# handle escaped quotes inside the literal, so it uses a negated character
# class that also permits escaped characters via `\.`.
# GNU/BSD `grep -E` does not recognize `\b` as a word boundary, so approximate one
# using start/end checks against non-identifier characters. This keeps `fixme` and
# `xxx` detections case-insensitive without tripping on identifiers such as
# `prefixme`. The panic! guard retains its escaped-quote handling.
